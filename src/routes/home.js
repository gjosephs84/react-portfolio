            <p>Driven by a passion for logic and process, I am a full-stack web developer in training, currently enrolled in the Professional Certificate in Coding course from MIT XPro.</p>

            <p>While I started writing HTML in the late 90s, my path to coding-as-a-career has been happily circuitous. While I am proud to have worked in the recreation department at MIT since 2005, I am also a published author of two novels, and have helped to feed my community as a weekly volunteer farm-hand since 2016.</p>
            
            <p>These diverse experiences outside the realm of coding have given me deep insight into the logic and processes that go into solving both tangible and intangible problems. They allow me a wealth of unique real-world perspective that I bring to each coding challenge I face.</p>
            
            <p>In coding, as in life, I believe there is always room for improvement. The first way of doing something is rarely the best way, and I’m constantly on the lookout for a better solution.</p>
            
            <p>I currently reside in Maynard, Massachusetts (just a stone’s throw from Boston) with my husband, two cats, and an Australian Cattle Dog.
